# Data Structures TP 1

This project is part of the Data Structures course at UFMG. It implements and analyzes sorting algorithms with experimental calibration of cost parameters.

## Project Structure

- `src/` — Source code files.
- `include/` — Header files.
- `entrada.txt` — Example input file.
- `results.txt` — Output file with experimental results.
- `Makefile` — Build instructions.

## How to Build

```sh
make
```

## How to Run

```sh
./tp entrada.txt
```

## Features

- Reads input parameters and data from a file.
- Implements and calibrates sorting algorithms (QuickSort, InsertionSort, Universal Sorter).
- Calculates and analyzes costs based on parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- Outputs experimental results for further analysis.

## Requirements

- GCC or compatible C compiler
- Make

## Authors

- Riquelme Batista Gomes da Silva
